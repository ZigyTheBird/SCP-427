# SCP-427
	SCP 427 is a small, spherical, ornately carved locket that can heal biological tissue and has a 10% chance of being obtained by upgrading SCP 500 on fine.
	SCP 427 heals 100 HP and applies the Vitality effect on use and can be used every 2 minutes.
	The Vitality effect will remain for 10 seconds:

	Configurability isn't the mods strong suit right now But hopefully that will be fixed in a future update.
